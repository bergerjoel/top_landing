# top_landing

This repository holds my current version of the [_Project: Landing Page_](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page), which is the final part of the [_Flexbox_](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#flexbox)course of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).
The goal of this exercise was to re-create a landing page from scratch using an image and a styling guide (see `resources`) as reference points. As I finished to rage-code the site, I did keep on working on it, trying to make it more responsive and to maintaining best-pracises for class-naming, structuring and so on. I intend to keep on adding to this repository in the future, treating it as kind of a starter kit for different flexbox elements.
